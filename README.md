### Threading Playtime

The purpose of these modules is simply a playground for me to learn about
Python Threads, Queues, Scheduling, interprocess communication
and related "things" ...

This is written against Python 3.4 initially but may be up/downgraded as necessary.
My initial target is a Raspberry Pi and, at the time of this writing has only Python 3.2
available but Jessie is out and may have a later version of Python available.
I'm writing this on a Mac and could use 3.5 but will hold back a bit.
